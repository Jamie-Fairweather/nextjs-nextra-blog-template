# A Day Trip to Emerald Park – Review

<Image src="/images/blogs/example/image1.jpg" alt="The Cú Chulainn Coaster at Emerald Park" />

Emerald Park might not be the biggest theme park in Europe, but for coaster fans it’s quietly becoming a must-visit. I did it as a day trip from the UK: flying out of Stansted early morning, landing in Dublin, and flying home that evening. From the airport, a taxi to the park cost around €60 each way — split between four of us, it worked out at about £27 each for a 30-minute journey. If you want to save, you can do the same trip on two buses for as little as €8 return, though at the expense of time.

The day started in the best possible way — our group had secured Early Ride Time on The Cú Chulainn Coaster. For 30 glorious minutes the wooden giant was ours, and we managed 12 back-to-back rides without leaving the station. Honestly, it set the tone for the whole day.

## Ride Highlights & Ratings

### The Cú Chulainn Coaster - 10/10

This ride alone justifies the trip. Comparable with the likes of Wodan at Europa-Park or Troy at Toverland, it’s relentless from the first drop and just keeps going. The unique 90-degree corner is unlike anything else I’ve ridden, but the whole layout flows so well that I found myself laughing through every lap.

- Front row: unbelievably exposed, the track stretching ahead as you crest each hill.
- Back row: a complete airtime machine, especially getting whipped over the lift hill and drops.

Simply put, Cú Chulainn is the heart and soul of Emerald Park.

### Na Fianna Force - 8/10

This new suspended thrill coaster is buttery smooth and wonderfully intense. Think Nemesis, but with lap bars instead of restrictive over-the-shoulder restraints. The comfort makes a huge difference, and I loved the fluid motion of its three inversions. I only rode it once during the day due to queues (just one train running), but I’d happily queue again for more.

### The Quest - 6/10

A family boomerang coaster that intertwines with Na Fianna Force in the new Tír na nÓg area. It's not intense — and it's not meant to be. As a family coaster, it does its job well, with the duelling visuals of both tracks twisting together.
